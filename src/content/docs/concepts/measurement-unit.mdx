A **Measurement Unit** is a standard quantity used to express the amount of an ingredient or food item in a recipe. Measurement units are used to quantify the amount of an ingredient or food item in a recipe. The measurement unit is typically a standard unit of measurement such as grams (g), milliliters (mL), cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, etc.

Recipes are developed worldwide and people use different measurement units based on where they are located. There are few systems of measurement units used worldwide:

| System       | Country                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metric       | Most countries in the world use the metric system. The metric system is based on the International System of Units (SI). The metric system uses units such as grams (g), milliliters (mL), liters (L), etc. |
| Imperial     | The Imperial system is used in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The Imperial system uses units such as ounces (oz), pounds (lb), pints, etc.                                                    |
| US Customary | The US Customary system is used in the United States. The US Customary system uses units such as cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, etc.                                                                         |

When preparing a recipe, the two most common types of measurement units used are:

- **Volume**: Volume is the amount of space occupied by an ingredient. Volume is typically measured in milliliters (mL) or liters (L) in the metric system and fluid ounces (fl oz) in the Imperial system.
- **Weight**: Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity. Weight is typically measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg) in the metric system and ounces (oz) or pounds (lb) in the Imperial system.

Depending on the system used, the measurement units may vary.

### United States

#### Volume

| Measurement Unit | Abbreviation | Equivalent | Notes           |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| teaspoon         | tsp          | 5 mL       |
| tablespoon       | tbsp         | 15 mL      |
| fluid ounce      | fl oz        | 30 mL      |
| cup              | cup          |            | See notes below |
| pint             | pt           | 480 mL     |
| quart            | qt           | 960 mL     |
| gallon           | gal          | 3.8 L      |

#### Weight

| Measurement Unit | Abbreviation | Equivalent | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| ounce            | oz           | 28 g       |
| pound            | lb           | 454 g      |

**Notes**

- For cups, there is no standard conversion available. The conversion depends on the ingredient and its density. For example, 1 cup of water is approximately 240 mL, while 1 cup of flour is approximately 125 g. When using `cups`, it is recommended to use a `cooking scale` for accurate measurements.
