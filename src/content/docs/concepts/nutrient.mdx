A Nutrient is a substance that provides nourishment essential for the maintenance of life and for growth. Any given food that we consume contains a variety of nutrients. When we consume food, our body breaks down the food into its constituent nutrients. The body then uses these nutrients to perform various functions. The body needs a variety of nutrients to function properly. Nutrients are used by the body to perform various functions such as energy production, growth, repair, and maintenance of cells and tissues.

Nutrients are found in food and are essential for the body to function properly. Nutrients are used by the body to perform various functions such as energy production, growth, repair, and maintenance of cells and tissues.

A Nutrient has a `name` and could further be classified into two categories:
- **Macronutrients**: These are nutrients that provide calories or energy. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These are generally measured in grams (g).
- **Micronutrients**: These are nutrients that are required in smaller amounts. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. These are generally measured in milligrams (mg) or micrograms (Âµg) or international units (IU).

There are many nutrients that could not be classified as either macronutrients or micronutrients, however, they are still essential for the body to function properly. These nutrients include water, potassium, and Chloride.
