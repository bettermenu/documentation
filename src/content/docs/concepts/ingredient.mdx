An **Ingredient** is a substance that is used in the preparation of a recipe. An ingredient can be a single food item or a combination of food items. An ingredient consists of the following components:

- **Quantity**: The amount of the ingredient that is used in the recipe. The quantity is typically a number, such as 1, 2, 1/2, 3 1/2 etc.
- **Unit of Measurement**: The unit in which the quantity is measured. Some of the common units of measurement are grams (g), milliliters (ml), cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, etc. Read [Measurement Unit](/concepts/measurement-unit) for more information.
- **Food**: The ingredient that is used in the recipe. The food can be a single ingredient, such as chickpeas, or a combination of ingredients, such as chickpeas and red onion. It could also be a another recipe or a food product. For example,
  - A recipe for "Pasta" could include a recipe for "Marinara Sauce" as an ingredient.
  - A recipe for "Chocolate Cake" could include a food product "Chocolate Chips" as an ingredient.

When following an online recipe, or a printed cookbook, ingredients can be located under the heading "Ingredients". Some of the ingredients may be optional, or may have alternatives.
