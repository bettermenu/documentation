A Recipe is a combination of ingredients and instructions that are used to prepare a meal for consumption. Some observations about a recipe are:

- A recipe can be as simple as a single ingredient or as complex as a dozen or more ingredients. 
- A recipe can be as simple as a single step or as complex as a dozen or more steps. 
- A recipe can be as simple as a single appliance or as complex as a dozen or more appliances. A recipe can be as quick as a few minutes or as long as a few hours.

No matter how simple or complex a recipe is, it always have a combination of some of the following elements:


### Ingredients

A recipe may include as little as one [food](/guides/food) or as many as a dozen or more. The amount of each food, combined with quantity and measurement unit is known as as **Ingredient**.
When following an online recipe, or a printed cookbook, these can be located under the heading "Ingredients". Some of the ingredients may be optional, or may have alternatives.

An example of ingredients from a `Vegan Chickpea Salad` recipe could be:
```
- 1 can of chickpeas
- 1/2 cup of diced red onion
- 1/2 cup of diced cucumber
- 1/2 cup of diced tomato
- 1/4 cup of chopped parsley
- 1/4 cup of chopped mint
- 1/4 cup of olive oil
- 1/4 cup of lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste
```

Some of the key points to note about ingredients are:
- The ingredient is typically written in one line with the following format: `<quantity> <unit> <food>`. For example, `1 cup chickpeas`.
- The ingredient always starts with a quantity. The quantity is the amount of the ingredient that is used in the recipe. The quantity is typically a number, such as 1, 2, 1/2, 3 1/2 etc.
- The quantity is followed by the unit of measurement. The unit of measurement is the unit in which the quantity is measured. Some of the common units of measurement are grams (g), milliliters (ml), cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, etc. The meausrement units used in 
different parts of the world may vary. For example, in the US, the measurement unit for volume is typically cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons, while in the UK, the measurement unit for volume is typically milliliters (ml) and liters (l). For more details, read [Cookbook:Units of measurement](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Units_of_measurement)
- The unit of measurement is followed by the food. The food is the ingredient that is used in the recipe. The food can be a single ingredient, such as chickpeas, or a combination of ingredients, such as chickpeas and red onion. The food is typically a noun, such as chickpeas, red onion, cucumber, tomato, etc.
