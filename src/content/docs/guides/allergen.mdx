title: Allergen

An allergen is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction in some people. Allergens are typically found in food and can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe. 

An allergen is identified in a single food in its raw form, for example, peanuts. So, it is easier for people who are allergic to peanuts to avoid them. 
However, when eating outside, or buying a packaged food, it is difficult to identify if the food contains an allergen. It is because of the following reasons:

- A package food is processed in a facility that also processes other foods. So, there is a risk of cross-contamination.
- A restaurant may use a product as an ingredient in their dish that contains an allergen.

Therefore, it is important for people who have allergies to be aware of the allergens in the food they consume. That means food manufacturers and restaurants should be transparent about the allergens in their food.
Some of the common allergens are:

- Peanuts
- Tree nuts
- Milk
- Eggs
- Fish
- Shellfish
- Soy
- Sesame
- Mustard
- Sulfites
- Lupin
- Molluscs

This is not a comprehensive list of allergens. There are many other allergens that can cause allergic reactions in some people. 

When creating recipes, it is extremely important to list the allergens in the recipe so that people who have allergies can avoid them.
