A **Dish** is a food item similar to a [recipe](/guides/recipe) that is prepared by combining multiple ingredients. In addition to individual ingredients, a dish also includes other recipes as ingredients.

A dish possesses all the properties of a recipe, such as a title, description, ingredients, instructions, etc. The place where it differs from a recipe is where it takes other recipes as ingredients.

An example of a dish could be a `Vegan Buddha Bowl` that includes `Quinoa`, `Roasted Chickpeas`, `Avocado`, `Hummus`, and `Tahini Dressing` as ingredients. While the dish has individual ingredients such as `Quinoa`, `Avocado`, it includes other recipes such as `Roasted Chickpeas`, `Hummus`, and `Tahini Dressing`.

The benefit of using a dish is that it allows you to break down a complex recipe into smaller, manageable recipes. This way, you can reuse the smaller recipes in multiple dishes. For example,

- The `Roasted Chickpeas` recipe can be used in multiple dishes such as `Vegan Buddha Bowl`, `Chickpea Salad`, etc.
- The `Hummus` recipe can be used in multiple dishes such as `Vegan Buddha Bowl`, `Hummus Wrap`, etc.
- The `Tahini Dressing` recipe can be used in multiple dishes such as `Vegan Buddha Bowl`, `Falafel Wrap`, etc.
